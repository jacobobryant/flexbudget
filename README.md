# FlexBudget

This is a simple CRUD app built with [Trident]. See [this article] for some information about the implementation. If you'd like to read the code,
a good starting point is `bud/backend/src/bud/backend/core.clj`. Currently deployed at https://notjust.us. If you're looking around
for a budgeting app, I recommend it.
