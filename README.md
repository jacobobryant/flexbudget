# FlexBudget

This is a simple CRUD app built with [Trident]. See [this article] for some
information about the implementation. If you'd like to read the code, a good
starting point is `bud/backend/src/bud/backend/core.clj`. Currently deployed at
https://notjust.us. If you're looking around for a budgeting app, I recommend
it.
